6\. The nature of the Contest and selection of Winners.

6.1\. To participate in the Contest, an individual must sign up for the competition on <https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7434> and join the Contest. Participants can participate in the Contest individually or in Teams of up to 5 members. To form a Team, Participants need to create a separate account for the Team and participate in the Contest using this account. Each participant can either participate individually or be a member of one Team only. In what follows, we use the term Team to refer to both a group of Participants or a single Participant (Team of 1).

6.2\. Throughout the duration of the Contest, Teams will work with data provided by the Organizer. The data consists of three parts: train set, public test set, and private test set. Below we discuss the construction of both sets.

- Train Set. Each entry to the Train set consists of the textual question, image associated with that question, and the ground truth bounding box. The annotations were obtained via crowdsourcing in two steps. First, crowd annotators were asked to draw a bounding box of an interesting object. Second, crowd annotators were asked to compose a textual question for the drawn bounding box.

- Public Test Set. The Public Test set is constructed in the same manner as the Train set, but the ground truth bounding boxes are not released to the participants (they are available to the Organizer).

- Private Test Set. The Private Test set is constructed in the same manner as the Train set, but it is not released to the participants (they are available to the Organizer).

6.3\. The goal of each Team is to develop a method to reconstruct the bounding boxes from the provided annotations. By the end of the Contest, Teams need to submit their predictions of the ground truth texts which will be evaluated on the public test set and the implementation of their solution which will be evaluated on the private test set. The submission must be generated by the code that only relies on publicly available data or on data collected on the Toloka crowdsourcing platform (see 7.4 for details).

6.4\. To compare submissions made by different teams, we use the intersection over union metric (IoU; see definition on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index> and on the contest page). Specifically, for each question in the test set, we compute the IoU metric between the ground truth bounding box and the prediction submitted by the team. We then average these values across all questions in the test set and the resulting quantity becomes the score of the team. The larger the score, the better.

6.5\. Throughout the Contest, Teams can submit their preliminary predictions to be evaluated on a public part of the public test set. These preliminary evaluations will be maintained on a public leaderboard visible to all Participants of the Contest.

6.6\. The Winning Teams of the Contest are determined by evaluating the quality of final predictions made by each Team against the private test set. Teams that achieve the top 3 best scores on these metrics become the Winners of the Contest. In case of a tie between two or more team, the teams that made their submission earlier will be ranked higher.

7\. Prizes

7.1\. The Winning Teams receive cash prizes in the following amount:

- 1st place: $3,000
- 2nd place: $2,000
- 3rd place: $1,000

If a Team consists of multiple Participants, the price will be divided equally across all members of the Team.

7.2\. There are a total of 3 Prizes to be won in the Contest.

7.3\. The Prizes are distributed by the Organizer through Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

7.4\. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

7.4.1\. Deliver to the competition organizer the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code must rely on publicly available data or on data collected on the Toloka crowdsourcing platform, be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. Provided software will not be used by the Organizer and is only required to ensure that the rules of the contest were not violated.

7.4.2\. If the solution uses data obtained on the Toloka crowdsourcing platform, a Prize won must also share the details of the project setup sufficient to reproduce the project. Specifically, the winner should provide a document describing the task interface design, quality control rules used, payment policy, and collected data. This information will not be used by the Organizer and is only required to ensure that the rules of the contest were not violated.

8\. Announcement of the Winners and distribution of the Prize.

8.1\. The Organizer announces the Winners by emailing them using the email address associated with their account. The list of Winners is also disclosed on the Contest website at the following link: <https://toloka.ai/challenges/wsdm2023/>

8.2\. The Prizes are distributed in equal installments proportionally to the number of Winning teams’ members. Winning teams will be asked to fill out a short form to specify the credentials of the members.

8.3\. The payment of the Prize is in no way guarantees you the right to or expectation that you may receive similar Prize with respect to any other similar performance.

8.4\. Winners are responsible to pay all applicable taxes.

9\. Miscellaneous. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between Participants and Organizer. The failure of the Organizer to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If for any reason any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give effect to the original intent of that provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.
